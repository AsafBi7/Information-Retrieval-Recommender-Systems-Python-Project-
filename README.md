# ***Information Retrieval & Recommender Systems – Final Project***

This mini-project implements a user-based collaborative filtering recommender system in Python. The system builds recommendations based on user similarity, computes predictions using the top-k most similar users, and evaluates how the choice of k impacts prediction error.

## **Core Tasks (based on assignment)**

- Construct a user–item rating matrix
- Compute pairwise cosine similarity between users
- Predict unknown ratings using weighted averages of top-k neighbors
- Evaluate performance using MAE
- Analyze prediction error as a function of k
- Compare against a variant that subtracts each user’s mean rating
- Visualize similarity and evaluation results

## **Methods & Techniques**

- User-based Collaborative Filtering
- Cosine Similarity
- Top-k Nearest Neighbors
- MAE Evaluation
- Similarity heatmaps and performance curves

## **Files Included**

- Information Retrieval & Recommender Systems - Final Project.ipynb – full implementation
- Ratings_Dataset_v2.csv – input rating dataset
- IR & RS Final Assignment.pdf – excerpt of the original task (coding part)
- 
## **Libraries**

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## **Notes**

This notebook was submitted as part of the final assignment in the Information Retrieval & Recommender Systems (0571.4160) course at Tel-Aviv University, and received full credit for the coding task.
